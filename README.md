# About This Repository

During the 6-week intership in ArVis technology, we need to build a project as a group. For doing this, I made several projects on object detection, object tracking and human pose estimation. 

First of all, I started to study basics of OpenCV. After that, trying to track objects with OpenCV trackers I used a few trackers such as GOTURN, BOOSTING and MIL. Then, for the purpose of detecting mobile-phone, I also worked on YOLOv4-YOLOv5 models. As a last step, I used Mediapipe Hands API to detect hand landmarks.
